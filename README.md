# vim-slme-ext-localtextfile

An extension of [vim-slime-ext-plugins](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime-ext-plugins) to send text to an already-existing `.txt` file in the current directory of a Vim or Neovim instance.

Done as an implementation of the example plugin in the documentation and `README` of [vim-slime-ext-plugins](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime-ext-plugins).
